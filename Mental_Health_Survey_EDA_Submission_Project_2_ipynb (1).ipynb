While awareness of mental health issues exists, gaps remain in workplace support, communication of benefits, and openness in discussing mental health concerns. The analysis shows that factors such as family history and organizational support play a stronger role in treatment-seeking behavior than age alone. Overall, the findings emphasize the need for inclusive mental health policies, improved awareness programs, and a supportive work culture to reduce stigma and promote employee well-being, ultimately contributing to better organizational performance."
